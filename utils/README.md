Usage: run with the correct version of pkgmcp2obf.srg from [MinecraftRemapping](https://github.com/agaricusb/MinecraftRemapping). It will generate two properties files.
These will contain mappings of names -> the relevant class names for obf'd or decompiled environments.

See the code for more info.
