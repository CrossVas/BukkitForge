Ports
=====


WHERE'D WORLDEDIT GO?
=====================

As of build 48, you _no longer need ports_. Except for a few mods, like PEX. Eventually, I aim to have those integrated with their vanilla bukkit counterparts.

It works by using code from [SrgTools](https://github.com/Frans-Willem/SrgTools), slightly modified for runtime use. See JavaPluginLoader for more info.
